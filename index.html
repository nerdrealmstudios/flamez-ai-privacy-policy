        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The Application uses a few necessary third-party services to provide its full functionality. These services operate under their own privacy policies:</p>
        <ul>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):</strong> The Application may load external font files and javascript libraries (like Typo.js) from Content Delivery Networks to function correctly. These services may collect non-personal data as described in their own policies.</p>
